          <h4>About MedGrocer</h4>
          <p>
            <em>MedGrocer</em>, a rapidly growing "medicine-as-a-service"
            company, offers digitally-enabled online pharmacy services,
            corporate clinics, and patient programs, empowering consumers to
            conveniently, cost-effectively, and intelligently access their
            medicines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond just delivering medicines, MedGrocer also delivers healthcare
            solutions for corporations: from analytics, to customized programs,
            to end-to-end fulfillment. They have expanded their services to
            include:

          <h4>MedGrocer's Objective</h4>
          <p>
            Multiple iterations of the MedGrocer website have been developed at
            various times, each one building upon the previous version and
            introducing upgrades. However, this iterative process has led to
            inconsistencies in both design and implementation across the
            different versions. Because of this, MedGrocer wants to unite the
            look and feel of their platforms under their signature branding
            which will then lead to a more consistent and easier user experience
            for their customers. MedGrocer would love to see how their platforms
            can have a more consistent feel while upholding QA standards and
            functionality.
